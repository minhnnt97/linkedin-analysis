The institute was founded with a mission: “To respect the dignity of persons suffering from neuropsychiatric disorders and addiction by bringing to bear a multidisciplinary research program aimed at elucidating the pathophysiology of these disorders, and develop novel therapeutics to improve the well-being of the individuals who suffer from them.”<br><br>LIBR's commitment to developing and maintaining a state-of-the-art research facility is evidenced by the newly completed research building (38,000 square feet) in Tulsa, Oklahoma. This space includes a research-dedicated MRI scanner room containing a state-of-the-art GE 750 3-Tesla MRI scanner, cutting-edge MRI head and neck coils, the most recent technologies for stimulus presentation and physiological monitoring, a scanner control room, two available MRI bays for expansion, a large video teleconferencing enabled meeting suite, several medical examination rooms and patient preparation rooms. <br><br>LIBR is a key member of a local bioinformatics collaborative research consortium involving the University of Tulsa, University of Oklahoma Medical School at Tulsa, and Oklahoma Medical Research Foundation.  This collaborative initiative allows faculty, graduate and medical students and fellows the opportunity to assist in the collection, analysis and publication of fMRI investigations. The studies undertaken by this consortium will facilitate the dissection of specific neuropsychiatric diseases and their related genetic or environmental influences that dictate responses to unique pharmacological or psychological therapies.
